## üìã Introduction

Deforestation and illegal tree cutting are pressing environmental issues. **Tree_Destruction-Monitoring-using-Arduino-UNO** leverages Arduino UNO to create an affordable and efficient monitoring system. By deploying sensors and microcontrollers, this project detects unusual vibrations or movements associated with tree destruction and sends alerts for prompt action.
